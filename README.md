# Cellule Core

## Project Overview

This project is the core application for the Cellule platform. It provides the necessary features and functionality to create and manage events, as well as send and receive messages in real-time.

## Project Explanation

Cellule is an ecosystem of applications that all follow the same principles of simplicity and clarity. Each application is interconnected through the Core application, which facilitates communication between them. For example, your calendar can send a route to the GPS app, or your email can notify the calendar of an event, etc.

The Core application is the central hub for all of these interactions. It provides the necessary features and functionality to create and manage events, as well as send and receive messages in real-time.

## Project Philosophy

The Cellule Core project is built on the following principles:

- **De-Google**: The project aims to provide an alternative to most used Google's services and applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Gmail, Google Maps, etc.).
- **Privacy**: The project should respect user privacy and data security.
- **Simplicity**: The project should be easy to understand and use.
- **Open Source**: The project should be open-source and free to use, modify, and distribute.

## Features

- **WebSocket Integration**: Enables the creation of events, connecting to them, and sending/receiving messages in real-time.
